                                            Indian economy is about to take off on fast growth trajectory. The proposal of  budget aims at making India fastest growing large economy in the world with  real GDP growth expected to be 7.4% in the coming year. Monetary policy  framework agreement with R B I have kept the inflation in downward control.  Maintaining the fiscal discipline it will be possible to achieve fiscal deficit  of 3% of GDP in the years to come. Realistic figures have shown by Hon&acute;ble  Finance Minister while presenting the budget without showing any exaggerated  revenue projections.&nbsp;<br />
                                            <br />

                                The penalty provisions are revamped. The changes will be effective from the date when Finance Bill, 2015 is passed and receives assent of President of
                                India. The changes are clarified in para 5.2 of MF (DR) letter DOF No. 334/5/2015-TRU dated 28-2-2015.

                                <strong><em>No show cause notice if service tax with interest paid before SCN</em></strong>
                                - Show cause notice cannot be issued if service tax with interest is paid before SCN. This is because show cause notice under section 73(1) of Finance Act,
                                1994 can be issued only when service tax has not been levied or pair or short levied or short paid or erroneously refunded.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This would be so even if there was suppression of facts, wilful misstatement etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Section 73(1) of Finance Act, 1994 does not make any mention of interest. However, proposed section 76(1) and section 78(1) of Finance Act specify that
                                show cause notice should mention interest. Thus, show cause notice must mention interest.

                                <strong><em>Immediate steps for recovery of self assessed service tax</em></strong>
                                - If an assesse declares amount of service tax payable by him in his ST-3 return (on self assessment) but does not pay the service tax, immediate recovery
                                proceedings can be initiated under section 87 of Finance Act, 1994, without issuing any show cause notice - proposed section 73(1A) of Finance Act, 1994.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The principle is that no demand notice is necessary for admitted liability.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thus, if amount involved is huge, it will be cheaper to delay filing of ST-3 return and pay late fee of Rs 20,000. However, department can allege
                                suppression of facts and penalty will become payable.

                                <strong><em>Penalty upto 10% even if no suppression or fraud</em></strong>
                                - Penalty upto 10% of service tax amount will be payable for violation of any provision of service tax law or rules, even when there was no charge of
                                suppression of facts or wilful misstatement - <em>proposed</em> section 76(1) of Finance Act, 1994.

                            <p>
                                However, if service tax with interest is paid before show cause notice, SCN cannot be issued at all, in view of section 73(1) of Finance Act, 1994. Hence,
                                question of penalty cannot arise.

                                Now section 206C has been amended to enable deductor to file correction statement. The proposed provision shall also incorporate the mechanism for

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The obtaining of TAN creates a compliance burden for those individuals or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) who are not liable for audit under section 44AB of
                                the Act. The quoting of TAN for reporting of Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) is a procedural matter and the same result can also be achieved in certain cases
                                by mandating quoting of PAN especially for the transactions which are likely to be one time transaction such as single transaction of acquisition of
                                immovable property from non-resident by an individual or HUF on which tax is deductible under section 195 of the Act.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To reduce the compliance burden of these types of deductors, it is proposed to amend the provisions of section 203A of the Act so as to provide that the
                                requirement of obtaining and quoting of TAN under section 203A of the Act shall not apply to the notified deductors or collectors.

                                filing self declaration in Form No.15G/15H for non-deduction of tax at source in accordance with the provisions of section 197A.

                                More fatal than any interest or penalty provisions, non-deductibility of tax at source on certain expenses will not allow you to claim such expenses in
                                computing your business income.

                                Further, the existing provisions of section 40(a) (ia) of Income-tax Act provide for the disallowance of expenditure like interest, commission, brokerage,
                                professional fees, and others. if tax on such expenditure was not deducted, or after deduction was not paid during the previous year. However, some
                                relaxation has been provided, in case the deduction of tax is made during the last month of the previous year, no disallowance is made if the tax is
                                deposited on or before the due date of filing of return. In addition to above, there are other penal provisions, relating to interest and penalty as below:

                                needs to be disclosed. In addition to that service tax attributable to service receiver i.e. Rs. 1, 39,050/- shall be disclosed on invoice so that the SR

                                The 14 Days time limit for issuing invoice increased to 30 days from the date of provision of service. The 14 Days time limit for issuing invoice increased
                                to 45 days in case of banking company / financial institutions. In case of continuous supply of services, 14 days time limit increased to 30 days of the
                                completion of each taxable event. No invoice is required to be issued in case of the amount received by service provider from service receiver is in excess
                                of amount mentioned in the invoice by Rs. 1000/-.

                                It will be evident from the above that in case of car hire, manpower supply, works contract; the liability is fastened on the recipient of service provided
                                the service provider is of specified person. In case of service provider is other organization like Company, Society, the tax is payable by the service
                                provider himself. The organization responsible for payment of service tax will also have to file ST-3 return for the payment of service tax made by them.
                                It has been the experience that during audit, the auditors invariably ask the company to tally the value of taxable service with the amount shown in the
                                ledger. It will therefore be advisable to maintain separate ledger code for the service for which service tax is payable under reverse charge and service
                                tax payable as service provider. This will help the company in reconciling the amount in the return.

                                    if the capital goods, in respect of which CENVAT Credit has been taken, are removed,
                                    after being used, the manufacturer or provider of output services shall pay an amount
                                    equal to the CENVAT Credit taken on the said capital goods reduced by the percentage
                                    points calculated by straight line method at the specified rate for each quarter

                                With respect to used capital goods, the amount that is required to be paid is cenvat
                                credit reduced by percentage points calculated on Straight Line Method for each

                                leviable on the transaction value, whichever is higher, remains unchanged.
                                <br />

                                    However, it has been specified that for capital goods cleared as

                                The amendment is summarised as follows -

                                <br />
                                (ii) An amount equivalent to duty leviable on Transaction value, whichever is higher.

                                received from Member (CX), Central Board of Excise &amp; Customs on the subject
                                cited above and to say that this Department has reconsidered the issue. It is reiterated
                                that in term of Order No. S.O. 862(E), dated 27 <sup>th</sup> October, 1980 as amended
                                by Order No. S.O. 87(E) dated the 3<sup>rd</sup> February, 1981, a duty of excise
                                shall be levied and collected as access for the purpose of development of industries
                                under the IDR Act, 1951 on paper &amp; paper boards, all sorts(including newsprint,
                                paste board, mill board, straw board, card board and corrugated boards). As regards
                                applicability of cess on paper products, Department of Industrial Development is
                                of the view that cess is leviable only on base paper. If, however, paper products
                                like waxed paper, coated paper etc. are produced as a result of single integrated
                                manufacturing process, cess becomes leviable on the product.

                                in his premises after buying base paper from the market. These views are based on
                                the advice of Ministry of Law.

                                2. It has been brought to the notice of the Board that there is lack of clarity
                                regarding the exemption from filing the Annual Financial Information Statement (ER-4)
                                prescribed under Rule 12(2)(a) of the Central Excise Rules, 2002 and the annual
                                declaration (ER-5) and the monthly return (ER-6) relating to Principal Inputs prescribed
                                under Rule 9A(1) and Rule 9A(3) of the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004 respectively.

                                3. Notification No. 17/2006-Central Excise (NT) dated 01.08.2006, as amended, issued
                                under Rule 12(2)(b) of the Central Excise Rules, 2002, inter alia, exempts assessees
                                who paid duty of excise less than Rs. One crore in the preceding financial year,
                                from filing the ER-4 return. Similarly, Notification No. 39/2004 Central Excise(NT)
                                dated 25.11.2004, as amended, issued Rule 9A(4) of the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004,
                                exempts the specified class of manufacturers who paid duty of excise less than Rs.
                                1 crore in the preceding financial year, from filling ER-5 declaration and ER-6
                                return. Notification No. 20/2010-Central Excise (NT) and Notification No. 21/2010-Central
                                Excise (NT) both dated 18.05.2010, prcised that assessee who paid total duty of
                                Rs. 10 lacs or more including the duty paid by utilization of CENVAT credit in the
                                preceding financial year, shall file such return/declaration electronically. A doubt
                                has arisen on account of the different threshold limits prescribed for exemption
                                from filing these returns and for filing these returns electronically.
                            </p>

                                4. The matter has been examined. The exemption provided under Notification No. 17/2006-Central
                                Excise (NT) dated 01.08.2006 and Notification No. 39/2004-Central Excise (NT), dated
                                25.11.2004, as amended, is available to interalia assessee who paid duty of excise
                                less than Rs. 1 crore including the amount paid by utilization of CENVAT credit.
                                It is, therefore, clarified that the assessees or class of assessees who are not
                                required to file the ER-4, ER-5 &amp; ER-6 returns because of the above exemption,

                                in which it was clarified that the Education Cess chargeable under Section 93(1)

                                by different departments such as Sugar Cess levied under Sugar Cess Act, 1982, Tea

                                1. Representations have been received in the Board seeking clarification on the applicability of section 194C on such transactions, where the assessee has
                                outsourced certain work relating to fabrication or manufacturing of article or thing in accordance with the specifications given by the assessee. Circular
                                No. 681, dated 8-3-1994 of the Board clarifies in para 7(<em>vi</em>) that the provisions of section 194C would not apply to contracts for sale of goods
                                and further clarifies that where the property in the article or thing so fabricated passes from the fabricator-contractor to the assessee only after such
                                article or thing is delivered to the assessee, such contract would be a contract for sale and so outside the purview of section 194C. However, in reply to
                                question No. 15 in Circular No. 715, dated 8-8-1995 on the subject of applicability of section 194C, in respect of contract for supply printed material as
                                per prescribed specifications, it has been said that such contracts would also be covered under section 194C. It has been represented that the views
                                expressed in these two circulars, to the extent as pointed out above, are in contradiction to each other.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                2. The matter has been examined by the Board and it is considered that exclusive reliance on Question&frasl;Answer No. 15 of Circular No. 715, without taking
                                into account the principles laid down in Circular No. 681 is not justified. Before taking a decision on the applicability of TDS under section 194C on a
                                contract, it would have to be examined whether the contract in question is a &lsquo;contract for work&rsquo;; or a &lsquo;contract for sale&rsquo; and TDS shall be applicable only
                                where it is a &lsquo;contract for work&rsquo;.

                                7. The conclusion flowing from the aforesaid judgments of the Supreme Court and the Patna High Court is that the provisions of section 194C would apply to
                                all types of contracts, including transport contracts, labour contracts, service contracts etc. In the light of these judgments, the Board has decided to
                                withdraw their above-mentioned Circular Nos. 86 and 93 and para 11 of Circular No. 108 and issue the following guidelines in regard to the applicability of
                                the provisions of section 194C:

                                (<em>b</em>) Where, however, the contractor undertakes to <u>supply any article</u> or thing <u>fabricated </u>according to the <u>specifications</u> given
                                by Government or any other <u>specified person</u> and the property in such article or thing passes to the Government or such person only after such
                                article or thing is <u>delivered,</u> the contract will be a <u>contract for sale</u> and as such outside the purview of this section.

                                FCBM performance of this agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process,
                                and nothing contained in this agreement is in derogation of FCBM's right to comply
                                with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to
                                your use of the FCBM sites/services or information provided to or gathered by FCBM
                                with respect to such use. If any part of this agreement is determined to be invalid
                                or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty
                                disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable
                                provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most
                                closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the agreement
                                shall continue in effect. Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes
